# Generic Section
Built to work with Shopify's new Sections for Homepages, this snippet can be adjusted to display a number of blocks of data. Duplicate the section and adjust it as needed.

## Implementation
1. Add the generic-section.liquid file to the sections folder in the site's theme. 
2. Rename the file to match your needs.
3. Update the content of the file to fit your needs.
__Note:__ This includes the "max_blocks" number, as well as the contents of the block and output of those fields.

## Other Requirements
While the section provides a large amount of customization for content types, the developer will need to adjust styling to match the provided design and other requirements.
