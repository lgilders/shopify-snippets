# shopify-snippets

This repo contains partials and instructions for several common features added to Shopfiy e-commerce websites.

### Blog Categories/Filters
Currently Shopify's built-in blog does not have a way to handle adding a "category" filter to blog posts. This section of snippets/documentation provides the illusion of WordPress-like category structure using Shopify's native tags.

### Mega Menu
Built with Shopify's native Navigation, this mega menu contains the bare bones for a standard site navigation and header, along with DOM for including custom images per sub-link title.

### Buy More, Save More Script
Built with Shopify's Script Editor app, this custom line item script checks the value of the items in the cart and implements a percentage discount based on that value. One version requires a discount code and the other does not.

### Hero Section
Built to work with Shopify's new Sections for Homepages, this same setup can be modified to fit other theme requirements.

### Free Shipping Script
Built with Shopify's Script Editor app, this custom shipping script looks for a specific shipping service and updates its cost to $0. One version requires a discount code and the other does not.
