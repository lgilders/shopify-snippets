# Featured Products Section
Built to work with Shopify's new Sections for Homepages, this custom section will display up a selection of featured products.

## Implementation
1. Add the featured-products.liquid file to the sections folder in the site's theme. 
2. From the site's admin, select the Homepage.
3. Add the new Featured Products section to the Homepage.
4. Customize the Featured Products section.
5. Save changes.

## Other Requirements
By default, this code will display up to 4 products. It also requires the use of a product-helper file to display the product information. The theme may already have one in the snippets folder, e.g., product-grid-item.liquid, product-card-grid.liquid, grid-item__product.liquid, etc. If the theme lacks one of these helpers, see the product-helpers folder for several options.
