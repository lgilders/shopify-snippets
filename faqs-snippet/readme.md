# FAQs Section
Because the new Sections only work for the Homepage, this snippet allows for a metafield-adminable section to display toggleable items as a FAQs example.


## Implementation
1. Copy the faqs-section.liquid file into the snippets folder of the theme.
2. Include the snippet in the appropriate page template where the section will be displayed. 
__Note:__ The metafields namespace and key values are hardcoded. To display different featured products sections on different page templates, then copy the liquid file and give it a unique name for each page template. Then update the namespace value to a unique one.
3. Save changes.
