2. In the left-hand rail, select Online Store.
3. In the left-hand rail, select Navigation.
4. In the right-hand section, select Blog menu.
5. Update existing Blog menu nav items or add a new nav item. 
  * Name of Collection - The name must match the tag used to tag individual blog posts to appear in that collection.
  * URL of Collection: /blogs/blog-name/tagged/collection-name - Multi-word tag names should be separated with a hyphen.
  * To include an All posts collection, create a nav item with an appropriate collection name and use the url of the blog, e.g., /blogs/blog-name.
  * When referencing the blog directly, you must type out the URL, not use the built-in page selector.

  * The tag must match the collection name set up as part of the Blog menu navigation.
  * By default, all posts will appear in the All posts collection. No tag is needed.

##Indicate a Primary Tag for a Blog Post
In some cases, you may wish to display a particular tag in association with a blog post, rather than relying only on a tag cloud.

2. In the left-hand rail, select Online Store.
3. In the left-hand rail, select Blog Posts.
4. In the right-hand section, select an existing blog post.
5. In the post’s tags, add a tag as the primary collection for this post with the naming convention primary-tag::tag name, e.g., primary-tag::buying guides.
  * The naming convention can be changed to anything you desire, but the display code will need to be updated to reflect the change.
6. Save changes.
